I have seen quite a few mothers abandon academia after having kids. I've read (but I won't put references cause I'm really bad at that; search the internet) that the leaky pipeline for women in sciences is at its leakiest after the first post-doc, which coincides with the time when women with degrees have kids. This is in accordance with my experience, not only with academia, but also with other ambitious professional careers. Women who quit are not worse researchers than women who stay. Many of them are brilliant, and it makes my heart bleed to see them go. What they lack in my opinion is a strong sense of who they are, and strategic thinking. That is, the fraud syndrome is worse in them, and they may not seek all the information that allows them to stay on track. When Baby Storm comes, they get swept away and by the time they recover their senses the glass in the ceiling has become granite.
