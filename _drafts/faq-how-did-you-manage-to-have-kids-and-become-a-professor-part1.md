Barely. What you see in a person's website or CV is the **what**, but not the **how**. And the how tends not to be very pretty. In my case, it was rather ugly, including two major nervous breakdowns (I suffer from brief psychotic episodes, but this will be for another post). 

My at-the-time-boyfriend-then-husband-now-ex and me always had wanted to have children. In that, we were of one mind. We were both doing our PhDs, and talking about having kids but in this sort of dreamish, someday kind of way. Then, a couple we were friends with told us they were expecting a baby. Things suddenly turned much more real: if they can do it, maybe we can, too? We started talking about it. Of course these friends were not doing their PhDs; we didn't know any PhD student with kids. We initially wanted to wait until we were done with it. But then, we reasoned, it's not like after the PhD we will have a permanent job, right? So we may as well start now. 

It was such a huge oversight. Of course we won't have a permanent job after the PhD, but a post-doc in which one is supposed to publish, go to conferences, move abroad, build a CV such that eventually the permanent position will be there. 

I had my first kid two years before finishing the PhD (but it took me seven years to finish. Not recommended), and I defended the PhD when I was one month pregnant with my second kid. The first kid was a huge stop, and when I was slowly resuming my conference-going, I had the second. In total, I was blocked from scientific life for five years. Ok, "blocked" is an exaggeration: I did finish my thesis during this time, and my first post-doc was during the second baby. But still, it was a time in which I swam in Baby Lane while everyone else around me was in Research Ocean. 

Do I regret it? Sometimes. Now I tend to be rather optimistic; my kids are 12 and 14, and I can be a fully functioning scientist again. I'm aware that waiting is not a good option, either; by the time I could have realistically have thought of having kids, I would probably have had fertility issues. But it was very, very tough, and I don't want to forget that.
