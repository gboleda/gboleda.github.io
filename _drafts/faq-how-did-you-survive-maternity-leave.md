I barely made it. My two maternity leaves are among the worst periods in my life. I was not brought up to be a housewife, and I didn't like it. Don't get me wrong; after the maternity leaves, I have great admiration for housewives. They do huge amounts of work with zero recognition. And it's work that never ends. By the time you're done with laundry, it has filled up again. Reminds me of [Sysiphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). Plus, because you are at home, everything gets dumped on you; I remember when we had to look for school for our older kid (in Spain, kids start school when they are 3 years old), and I visited all the schools in the neighborhood while my then-husband-now-ex worked. After all, I was all day idling at home and looking at my baby in the eyes in extasis, right? 

Well, no. I was lonely and miserable. I obsessed over laundry. Everyone in my social cirle worked. And cities are not made for moms with small kids. By the time you are dressed, the baby is dressed and fed and cleaned and fed and cleaned and dressed again and put in the pram, and you manage to get to the street, it's already time to go fetch the older kid in kindergarten. I had some friends with babies, but they lived in other parts of the city, or outside of the city. I tried to bond with the moms in the fitness-for-moms-and-babies sessions that my health center offered, but they were so different from me. I felt like an octopus in a garage* both with them and with my earlier friends (those with no babies, that is, the large majority). The few precious occasions in which I could manage to go out with them in the evening, the conversation revolved around books and movies, a galaxy away from me. All I wanted to talk about was breastfeeding. 

I also loved my kids, of course. But this post is not about that. It's about how hard it can be for a working woman to suddenly be confined at home with a baby -- for months. Motherhood is not always great. I didn't like taking care of my kids' poop (that part I delegated to their dad whenever possible). I missed my work, my friends, and being an individual. With my second child, I took an extended leave of six months (maternity leaves were 16 weeks in Spain at the time), because I didn't like to pump milk and the WHO says that babies should be exclusively breast-fed for six months. My then-husband-now-ex told me all the time: "Gemma, you should go back to work." And me: "No, because the WHO..." But he was SO right. If I had another baby, I would go back to at least part-time working after two weeks.
