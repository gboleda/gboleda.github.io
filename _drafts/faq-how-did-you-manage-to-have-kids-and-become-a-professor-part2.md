Ok, so I was saying that it was very tough. But I didn't really answer the "how" question, apart from stating that I did indeed have kids, which is arguably a prerequisite to having kids and becoming a professor.

I went through my ups and downs with respect to academia; in particular, after the PhD I was not sure if I wanted to try and become a professor or move to some other option. Well, I think that actually I wanted it but I was not sure that I was good enough. Ever heard of the [fraud syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)? I was a fraud, obviously, so why bother?

But I've always had a very strong sense of will. My best sense of will doesn't come from my brain, but rather from my guts, my stomach in particular. There's something there that will make me stop fooling myself ("you're not an ambitious person"; "you should spend more time with the kids"; "really, why bother") and switch gears towards what I truly want, who I truly am. The problem is that my brain is rather strong-willed, too, and the two tend to fight, with disastrous consequences for me. I suffer from brief psychotic episodes, and they were much worse when the brain used to win all the fights. I've slowly learned to do as my stomach says, and I'm (a) much happier, (b) less sick. 

I also have good strategic  thinking. I've always been afraid of ending up without a roof over my head. I am very afraid of not being able to cover my basic needs. This fear has made me suffer quite a bit, but it has also always protected me. I've always had B plans, and savings, and I've always considered all the possible options. And I think that this fear is the reason I've developed good strategic thinking. This has turned out to be very useful for academia. When Baby Storm hit, it caught me prepared; for instance, I knew all about post-doctoral fellowships, and that allowed me to secure a post-doctoral position in my hometown while the second baby grew up to be a toddler. 

Last but not least, my mom was herself a scientist. When I became immersed in Baby Pool, she always reminded me: "they grow up and leave; don't leave everything else; you should have a life of your own". It annoyed me and my hormones no end, but it was very good advice. And I followed it.
